# Hey Friend!
I'm Spider. You may also know me as A'zhek. I'm a hobbyist software developer,
tending to focus my efforts on projects that help people & communities close to me. 

My weapon of choice is OOP. Specifically, Java and C#.

I am currently employed at [\${publicly_traded_company}](/) working as a [\${job_title}](/). 

# Top of Mind:

Consolidating the various online services I use, and determining the effort required to fully migrate to Linux.
