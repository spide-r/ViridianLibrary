# Hey Friend!
I'm Spider. You may also know me as A'zhek. I'm a hobbyist software developer,
tending to focus my efforts on projects that help people & communities close to me. 

My weapon of choice is OOP. Specifically, Java and C#.

I am currently employed at [\${publicly_traded_company}](/) working as a [\${job_title}](/). 

# Commissions 
- Have an idea that you think would make an excellent XIV Plugin?
- Do you think to yourself "I really wish this tool existed"?
- Are you a part of a community that doesn't have it's niche met by existing sites, discord bots, or other software?

Lets chat on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/spiiiiiiiiider.bsky.social)!

Rates will depend heavily on the type of work needed. I am able to contribute to both open and closed source projects.

Check my [projects](/projects) to see what I like to do and what I'm capable of.

# Top of Mind

- Consolidating the various online services I use
- Learning and applying IaC concepts
- Rebooting after the holiday season
